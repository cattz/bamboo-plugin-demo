You have successfully created an Atlassian Plugin!

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

***** Notes

For IntelliJ intellisense support (for all dependencies to properly resolve in the editor) .. you will need to manually add classpath (in IDE) to Bamboo lib directory at
/target/bamboo/webapp/lib   (these are the Bamboo jars that will be downloaded after the first succesfuly atlas-run execution).
